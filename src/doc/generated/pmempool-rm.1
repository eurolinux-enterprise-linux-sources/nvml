\f[B]pmempool\-rm\f[] \-\- Remove (unlink) poolset files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ rm\ [<options>]\ <file>..
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[] invoked with \f[I]rm\f[] command removes (unlinks)
all files specified in command line arguments.
If the specified file is a poolset file all parts will be removed.
All files are removed using the \f[B]unlink\f[](3) call.
Without specifying the \f[B]\-i|\-\-interactive\f[] option, the
\f[I]rm\f[] command prompts only before removing
\f[I]write\-protected\f[] files.
If specified file does not exist the \f[I]rm\f[] command terminates with
error code.
The \f[B]\-f|\-\-force\f[] command ignores non\-existing files and never
prompts before removing a file.
See \f[B]EXAMPLES\f[] section for example usage of the \f[I]rm\f[]
command.
